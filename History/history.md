## **Early Origins and Settlement**
1. **Pre-1790s:** The region was largely untouched by European settlers. It was considered a “dismal wilderness” in early maps, part of the “Land of the Iroquois,” used primarily as transitional hunting and fishing grounds by Indigenous groups like the Oneidas and the Canadian Iroquois.
2. **1791 Macomb’s Purchase:** New York State sold over 3.6 million acres of northern land to speculators Alexander Macomb, William Constable, and Daniel McCormick. This opened the area to settlement.
3. **1797-1798:** Township 11 (later Lowville) was surveyed and subdivided. Nicolas Low, a Dutch-descended landowner, conveyed land to his agent Silas Stow, who promoted settlement around Mill Creek.
4. **1798:** Daniel Kelley and his six sons arrived from Connecticut, building a sawmill and a two-story house. His family played a foundational role in the town’s early development.

## **Village Incorporation and Infrastructure**
1. **1854:** Lowville was incorporated as a village—the first in Lewis County.
2. **1855:** The Black River Canal reached Lowville, boosting trade and connectivity.
3. **1864:** Lowville was designated the county seat, replacing Martinsburg.
4. **1867:** The Utica and Black River Railroad extended to Lowville, further enhancing its role as a regional hub.

## **Wartime and Civic Development:** 
 - **War of 1812 & Civil War:** Many residents served in the U.S. military during these conflicts, temporarily slowing local growth.
